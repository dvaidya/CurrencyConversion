# CurrencyConversion

1) Created a server using node.js to be accessible on localhost : 3000
2) Drop down selector for chosen currency (GBP), a calender input to select date, rates on that date
3) Used CSS preporocessor for landing page
4) Subscription to rates API allows rates for only today's date so the project has rates on EUR to all currencies 
   for today's date
5) Error messages for server errors and input validation and available rates
